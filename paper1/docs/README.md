# paper1 — LaTeX source

Self-contained LaTeX source for the arXiv preprint.

> *Action-Conditioned Predictive Consistency as a Diagnostic for Gaussian-Noise Robustness in JEPA World Models*

Companion plan / storyline doc: `PLAN.md` (next to this README).

## Layout

```

├── main.tex          # the paper (article class)
├── references.bib    # bibliography entries; final source audit is tracked in reference_audit.md
├── figures/          # symlink → ../assets/paper1_figs/
├── build.sh          # `bash build.sh` (uses latexmk if available, else pdflatex + bibtex)
├── .gitignore        # ignores LaTeX intermediates; main.pdf is tracked intentionally

└── docs/main_blind.tex
```

## Build

Requires `texlive-latex-recommended` + `texlive-bibtex-extra` (or any TeX distribution with `pdflatex`, `bibtex`, and the packages listed in `main.tex`).

```bash
bash build.sh           # builds main.pdf
bash build.sh --clean   # remove intermediates first
```

To regenerate the script-generated main data artifacts and figures before building:

```bash
cd ..
python -m tools.paper1_base_noise_cliff_multistd
python -m tools.paper1_three_seed_gaussian_sweep
python -m tools.paper1_figs --out-dir assets/paper1_figs
OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 MPLCONFIGDIR=/tmp/mplconfig \
python -m tools.paper1_selective_contraction \
  --plot-clusters --plot-tasks PushT \
  --n-sequences 128 --cluster-anchor-count 16 \
  --view-stds 0.0 0.01 0.04 0.08 \
  --cluster-perturb-repeats 6 \
  --feature-cache-dir /tmp/paper1_selective_contraction_cache \
  --cluster-out-dir assets/paper1_figs \
  --cluster-envelope ellipse --cluster-envelope-coverage 0.90 \
  --metric-summary assets/paper1_data/compressed_metrics_summary_20260706.json \
  --cluster-paper-facing
```

The ACPC neighborhood t-SNE figure is qualitative. It reuses cached PushT feature arrays in `/tmp/paper1_selective_contraction_cache`; the cache itself is not committed.

Paper-specific tool usage is documented in `../tools/README_paper1.md`.

## Submitting to arXiv

The current source is configured as an arXiv-style non-anonymous draft. Before submitting, replace the `\arxivauthors` placeholder in `arxiv_metadata.tex` with the real author list and verify the public code/data URL printed after the abstract.

Current public companion repository: `https://github.com/Anguo-star/lewm-acpc-diagnostics`.

For a double-blind conference variant, use `docs/main_blind.tex` and run `bash paper1/docs/check_blind_ready.sh` from the repository root. The blind path compiles the same paper with anonymous authors, hides the public code URL and acknowledgements, and creates `/tmp/paper1_blind_src.tar.gz` without `arxiv_metadata.tex` or `arxiv_release_notes.tex`.

arXiv source upload should contain only files required to compile the paper. Do not upload `PLAN.md`, `CODEX_SUBMISSION_READINESS.md`, `ARXIV_V1_READINESS_PLAN.md`, checker logs, old PDFs, raw experiment JSON, or other internal planning files.

To prepare and audit a source tarball, prefer the checked helper:

```bash
cd ..
bash paper1/check_arxiv_ready.sh
tar -tzf /tmp/paper1_arxiv_v1_src.tar.gz | sort
```

For scoped source packaging, `paper1/scripts/collect_tex_figures.py` parses `\includegraphics{...}` targets from the TeX entry point and copies the referenced figures from the configured `\graphicspath` locations. Passing `--table-out-dir` additionally copies only referenced `tables/...` inputs, excluding historical tables that are not part of the submission:

```bash
cd paper1
python scripts/collect_tex_figures.py --tex main.tex --base-dir . \
  --out-dir /tmp/paper1_arxiv_src/figures \
  --table-out-dir /tmp/paper1_arxiv_src/tables
```

The source package intentionally excludes `main.pdf`, unused figures, and local build products; the TeX source path includes `main.bbl`, whose basename matches `main.tex`. Both readiness scripts extract their generated tarballs into a fresh `/tmp` directory and compile there, so missing packaged inputs or figures fail the release gate.
