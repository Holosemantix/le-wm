# Reference Audit

## 2026-07-11 concurrent-work remediation

Six concurrent papers named in the remediation plan were checked directly
against their official arXiv abstract records and added to
`paper1/references.bib`.  The audit uses only claims supported by those records
and by the ATM method section on the official arXiv HTML page.

| Key | Official source | Verified scope used in Paper 1 |
|---|---|---|
| `yan2026mwm` | https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.07799 | MWM trains an action-conditioned consistency objective and few-step diffusion distillation for image-goal navigation; it is a method, not a post-hoc Gaussian checkpoint audit. |
| `chen2026atm` | https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.09028 | ATM trains fresh inverse probes on real-encoded and model-predicted transition domains and evaluates their transfer matrix; it diagnoses action identifiability rather than paired visual-perturbation radius. |
| `zhang2026deltajepa` | https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.31232 | Delta-JEPA adds latent-difference action decoding during training to make transition geometry action-sensitive and collapse-resistant. |
| `seo2026acid` | https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.02403 | ACID adds inverse-dynamics cycle action consistency to the decision-time planning cost; it changes planning rather than auditing frozen perturbation pairs. |
| `ruan2026futurecompatible` | https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.07514 | Action-state compatibility is used to diagnose and select generated World Action Model rollouts; the paper explicitly identifies static/background-collapse failures. |
| `schaefer2026kinematic` | https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.05966 | iKCE diagnoses a kinematic-versus-dynamic long-horizon failure on a DreamerV3 walker checkpoint; it targets physical regime sensitivity rather than visual-noise invariance. |

The direct-comparison matrix in `paper1/main.tex` now separates four axes:
training objective vs post-hoc diagnostic, paired same-state visual stress,
action-identifiability/dynamic-consistency signal, and whether the planner is
modified.  Consequently Paper 1 claims a narrow paired-radius and fixed-pool
calibration study, not priority over action consistency in general.

### ATM feasibility record

The official ATM method requires, for every checkpoint, two freshly trained
two-layer inverse probes over a fixed offline train/validation split: one on
real encoded transition features and one on model-predicted transition
features.  The full transfer matrix then evaluates both probes in both domains;
its screening score additionally fits task-specific coefficients on candidate
models.  As of this audit, the arXiv page says code *will* be released, and the
linked repository does not form part of this frozen release.  Paper 1 therefore
does **not** label encoder/H1/action-shuffle baselines as ATM.  Reproducing ATM
would introduce a new probe-training protocol and, for its screening score,
behavior-linked coefficient fitting after the public-v1 gate was frozen.  It is
recorded as a prospective method-comparison experiment rather than silently
approximated.  The current behavior-blind baseline table instead reports exactly
what was run: encoder-only, H1, H8, action-zeroed/shuffled, time-shuffled, SMPR,
and the frozen joint gate.

Date: 2026-07-04

2026-06-22 release-readiness pass: bibliography count rechecked after the submission-readiness review. `paper1/references.bib` contains 44 entries, and the README no longer hard-codes a count.

2026-06-26 targeted fix: corrected `kostrikov2020drq` author order to match the official OpenReview record (`Kostrikov, Yarats, Fergus`) after the strict reviewer audit.

2026-06-26 post-theory validation pass: added `littwin2024jepaavoidsnoisyfeatures` after the post-modification theory audit identified it as a directly relevant JEPA noisy-features theory paper.

2026-06-26 collision-framing pass: added `chen2025reoi` after a targeted check for robust visual MPC and action-outcome-prediction work. Text-use remains bounded: ReOI is cited as a neighboring robust visual MPC intervention, while ACPC is positioned as a paired diagnostic for existing JEPA latent-world-model checkpoints rather than as a new observation-intervention policy.

2026-06-08 final pass: rechecked the temporally unstable 2025/2026 entries against official arXiv, OpenReview, Nature, ICLR, and PMLR pages. The main live checks covered `maes2026lewm`, `maes2026stableworldmodel`, `huang2026vjepa`, `klindt2026lejepaworldmodel`, `usjepa2025`, `njepa2025`, `toso2026bisimjepa`, `assran2025vjepa2`, `vigmo`, `ghaemi2025seqjepa`, `voelcker2025calibratedvalueaware`, `hafner2025dreamerv3`, `dupuis2023vibr`, `gelada2019deepmdp`, `hansen2024tdmpc2`, and `bsmpc`. 2026-06-10 targeted recheck updated `maes2026stableworldmodel` from the earlier workshop v1 record to the newer arXiv platform paper and removed an unsupported precise VJEPA noisy-distractor number.

2026-06-11 targeted recheck: re-opened the official arXiv/OpenReview records for `maes2026lewm`, `maes2026stableworldmodel`, `huang2026vjepa`, `klindt2026lejepaworldmodel`, `toso2026bisimjepa`, `assran2025vjepa2`, `vigmo`, `usjepa2025`, `njepa2025`, and `bardes2024vjepa`. No bibliography metadata changes were needed. Text-use remains bounded: V-JEPA 2 is cited for understanding/prediction/planning; Huang VJEPA is cited only for noisy-environment nuisance filtering without a precise numeric claim; ViGMO is cited for visual distractions and latent consistency; Bisim-JEPA is cited for control-relevant invariant visual representations, with the main text now explicitly stating that ACPC is not a learned bisimulation metric.

2026-06-16 targeted collision check: added `wang2026groupactions` after checking the official arXiv record. Text-use remains bounded: the paper is cited for formalising action-conditioned video world modeling as a group action and for GAC/GAR-style action-faithfulness metrics; ACPC is explicitly separated as same-action paired visual-perturbation predictive-consistency diagnostics with a discriminability guard.

2026-07-04 targeted top-conference pass: rechecked key temporally unstable JEPA/world-model and robustness references against primary arXiv/OpenReview/Nature/PMLR sources. Added `murlabadia2026vjepa21` for V-JEPA 2.1 after checking arXiv:2603.14482; text-use is bounded to V-JEPA-family dense physical-world representations and does not imply a competing baseline.
2026-07-04 correction pass: rechecked ReOI against arXiv:2506.16565 and corrected the bib title/author metadata from an earlier wrong record to Chen, Wei, Xu, Li, Tomizuka, Bajcsy, and Tian.

2026-07-13 submission-remediation spot check: re-opened the official arXiv
records for the six recent action-consistency papers cited in the compressed
Related Work paragraph: `yan2026mwm`, `chen2026atm`, `zhang2026deltajepa`,
`seo2026acid`, `ruan2026futurecompatible`, and
`schaefer2026kinematic`. Their current abstracts support the manuscript's
bounded distinctions among consistency-aware training, post-hoc action probes,
latent action decoding, decision-time cycle consistency, generated-future
compatibility, and kinematic-failure diagnostics. No metadata or claim-text
change was required.

Scope: all 51 citation keys used in `paper1/main.tex`. Unused BibTeX entries were removed from `paper1/references.bib`, so every remaining entry is cited.
